## Introduction

Image processing is a crucial aspect of computer vision and has a wide range of applications, including medical imaging, surveillance, object detection, and more. This project aims to provide a collection of Python scripts and tools for image processing tasks.

## Features

- **Edge Detection**: Detect edges and boundaries in images using techniques like Sobel, Canny, etc.
- **Grayscale**: Convert images to grayscale for various analysis and processing purposes.
- **Negative Transformation**: Transform images to their negative form for artistic or analytical purposes.
- **Gaussian Blur**: Apply Gaussian blur to images to reduce noise and smooth out details.
- **Reduce Noise**: Remove noise from images using filters like median filter, bilateral filter, etc.
- **Sharpening**: Enhance the sharpness and clarity of images to improve visual quality and detail.

## Installation

To use this project, you'll need Python installed on your system.it's recommended to use a virtual environment like `pycharm .
